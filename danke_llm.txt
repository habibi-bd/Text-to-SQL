#Why we create a view in SQL Query Compilation?

Problem without a view:
    If a user asks a question like:
    "Show all customers from New York who made orders above 500"
    The LLM has to figure out:
    Which table to use? (customers and orders)
    How to join them ? Customer.id = orders.customer_id
    Which columns to select? (Customer.name, orders.amout)
this is so, complitecated, espicalliy for real world db with many tables and foreign keys. The LLM could make 
mistake to joins

solution: 
    We create a pre-joined view that already combines all the necessary tables:
        CREATE VIEW V AS
        SELECT *
        FROM Customer
        JOIN Orders ON Customer.id = Orders.customer_id;
    Now , LLM does not need to worry about joins. It only writes simple SQL query over the V 


Benefits: 
    Simplifies LLM reasoning: LLM sees just one table (the view) instead of multiple tables.
    Reduces errors in joins: No risk of wrong foreign key connections.
    Works for complex schemas: Even if the database has 20–30 tables, the view only includes the relevant tables.
