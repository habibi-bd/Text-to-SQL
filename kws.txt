Goal: 
Convert a natural language (NL) question into a working SQL query using LLMs, with help from a keyword search system (KwS) and schema linking.

1. User Question (NL Input):
“List all customers in the Sales department with pending orders.”

2. Scehma linking (Identify which tables and columns in the database are relevant.)
Identify which tables and columns in the database are relevant.

    map terms: 
    Map terms from the question to schema elements:
    customers → Customer table  
    Sales department → Department table

    pending orders → Order.status column

3.Knowledge-enhanced Search (KwS):

    Retrieve extra information about the database:
    Table relationships
    Column descriptions or sample values

Helps the LLM understand how to join tables correctly.


4. LLM Integration:

The LLM takes the NL question + schema links + extra context and reasons about how to write SQL.

5. SQL Query Generation:
    LLM produces a SQL query:
    # inside code kws.py


6. SQL Query Execution:

    The SQL query is sent to the database engine.

7. Result Retrieval:

    The database returns the final data to the user.

    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie
